### Firebase Configuration

1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication and configure Email/Password sign-in method
3. Copy `.firebaserc.example` to `.firebaserc` and replace `your-project-id` with your actual project ID:
   ```bash
   cp .firebaserc.example .firebaserc
   ```
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Firebase configuration values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
5. Get your Firebase config from Project Settings > General > Your apps
6. Add your domain to Firebase's authorized domains in Authentication > Settings

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Firebase Emulators

To test with Firebase emulators:

```bash
# Auth emulator only
npm run dev:emulator:auth

# Hosting emulator only (builds app and serves it)
npm run dev:emulator:hosting
```

Hosting emulator serves the app at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Router v7 (SPA mode)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth (Email/Password)
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

This application runs in SPA (Single Page Application) mode and generates static assets for deployment.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates optimized static files in the `build/client/` directory.

### Firebase Hosting Deployment

Deploy to Firebase Hosting using the Firebase CLI:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
npx firebase deploy --only hosting
```

Your app will be available at `https://your-project-id.web.app`

### Environment Variables

The Firebase configuration is embedded in the build. Make sure your `.env.local` contains your Firebase project settings before building:

```bash
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### Domain Configuration

After deployment, add your production domain to Firebase Authentication's authorized domains:
1. Go to Firebase Console > Authentication > Settings
2. Add your domain to "Authorized domains"

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
